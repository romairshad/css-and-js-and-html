                    <p>Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling
                        data with the
                        goal
                        of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data
                        analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of
                        names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today's
                        business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping
                        businesses operate more effectively.</p>
